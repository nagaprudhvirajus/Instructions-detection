Adaptive Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Overview

This project presents an Adaptive Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines advanced machine learning techniques to minimize false positives and false negatives in threat detection. The system leverages both traditional classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to deliver a scalable, high-performance solution for network security.

Key Technologies & Algorithms

The following algorithms and methods are explored and integrated in the system:

Traditional Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Ensemble Learning: Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.

Deep Learning: Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

Hybrid Model: Integration of Random Forest, XGBoost, and DNN for enhanced detection capabilities.

Feature Optimization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for improved computational efficiency and detection precision.

Dataset

The system was evaluated using well-established network security datasets:

NSL-KDD: A refined version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset, containing labeled network traffic for training IDS systems.

KDD Cup 99: A standard dataset used to evaluate IDS models, including a wide range of attack types.

Objectives

To improve IDS performance in detecting sophisticated cyberattacks by minimizing false positives and false negatives.

To evaluate and compare traditional machine learning models against ensemble methods and deep learning techniques.

To create a robust and adaptive IDS framework that can scale with evolving network environments.
